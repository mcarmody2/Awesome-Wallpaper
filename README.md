<h1>AwesomeWallpaper</h1>
<p>
AwesomeWallpaper downloads the best pictures every day for your desktop wallpaper to keep it interesting.  It is a script made to work with a cron job (scheduled execution) to download new photos every day.

<h1>Setting up AwesomeWallpaper is easy!</h1>
<p>
1:  Make sure Python is installed (it probably already is, but if not, go into terminal and type "python" and see if anything happens. If nothing, install it!)<br/>
2:  Choose a directory for your wallpapers, it can be anywhere<br/>
3:  In settings, point your wallpaper directory to that directory, make sure it allows multiple wallpapers as well as timed switching<br/>
4:  Download <b>~get_todays_wallpapers.py</b> and put it in the same wallpapers directory<br/>
5:  Create a cron job to run <b>~get_todays_wallpapers.py</b> at the interval you choose*

If that scares you, I recommend using Google's free software <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cronnix/">CronniX</a> to schedule cron jobs (only Mac OSX).
